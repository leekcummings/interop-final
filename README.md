# Interoperability Final Project

For this project, I chose to analyze my save data from the video game [Celeste](https://www.celestegame.com). This project is split into 3 parts.

### Part 1: Converting XML to HTML
Taking my first Celeste save data file, which was stored in XML, I pulled out relevant data using regular expressions, and outputted the data into an HTML file.

### Part 2: Creating a Matplotlib bar chart
